As the name says, roll_a_dice is the python programmed to get a random output of throwing a single dice at once. and any random outcome between 1 to 6 can be there. We can keep rolling if we press R and to stop the same we can press Q.

For toss_a_coin or fliping coin, code is almost same. I used random library and randint class from the same. For any random output between 1 or 2. That will be changed with Heads or Tails respectively. To Flip press F and to stop press S.

It's fun. Give it a try.
